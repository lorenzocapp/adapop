### Required package:
* [`adapref`](https://github.com/lorenzocapp/adapref)
* [`phylodyn`](https://github.com/JuliaPalacios/phylodyn)
* [`ape`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html)



* scenarios.R: all possible scenarios we're considering. Function definining effective population size.

* data_generation_aistats.R: 
Generate all the simulated dataset in the data folder. Create folder. Require scenarios.R.


* master_inla_simulation_server_aistats.R
Batch file to be run in server/cluster.
library(phylodyn)
library(ape)
Need "functions_inla_selection.R": include all utilities, with methods to run the file. 
Load simulated data generated by data_generation_aistats.R (5 scenarios, 100 seeds) and do all inference.
precz: precision parameters.
comb: combination
It also does evaluation of the inference (that's why we need scenarios.R)
also sample from posterior

"functions_inla_selection.R"
=> beta version of adapref









### real_data
This folder contains files used for producing the real data analyses.

#### GISAID_IDs
Each text file contains 150 sequences. 

The GISAID EPI_SET IDs and DOI for web viewing can be found in Table S2 of the Supporting Information.   

#### XML
This folder contains BEAST2 xml files. 

The data block has been removed. The necessary genetic data can be downloaded from GISAID using the IDs in the [GISAID_IDs](real_data/GISAID_IDs) folder.
